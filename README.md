============

Short, simple, direct scripts for creating ASCII graphical histograms in the terminal.

Purpose
=======

If you desire a script to generate a graphical histogram from the terminal, directly
in the terminal, then use one of the scripts in this repository. At first, there will
be only one, the original written in Perl by Tim Ellis. But if others port it to Python,
Ocaml, COBOL, or Brainfuck, then we'll include those versions here.
